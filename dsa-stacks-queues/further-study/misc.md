Browser Back/ForwardÂ»

Design how you could design a browser back/forward system using two stacks, so that you can visit a series of sites (Google, Yahoo, EBay, go back to Yahoo, then forward again to EBay, then onto Apple, and so on).

Write pseudo-code for this.


What happens when you go back?
pop off back stack
push to forward stack?

When going forward, you push items onto the back stack, as you pop off the forward
stack
